Introduction:
The essential story being told by my portfolio site is a version of me becoming a graphic designer in 10 years. This version of me represents that
I have expended my creative horizons and polished skills in the design world. The audience I am addressing includes potential future clients or 
industries who might have interest in my work. For my structure, I chose to implement a modern design emphasizing a clean layout which reflects 
to my capabilities in the design world.

Inspiration:
Site1: BrandAffair: This website inspired me to prioritize simplicity the way this site has made me realise how to make my contact page stand out
Site2: Igor Terekhov: This website has caught my attention with it's smooth animation. From this, I have learned how to make my website more 
interactive for my users by incorporating animation into my website.
Site3: BRENNA HAMILTON: This website has a unique way to display it's work to the user. From what i have learned is that presentation is as 
important as design.

Accessibility:
My site is a desktop only site fully compatible with screen readers, ensuring that all text content including headings, descriptions and buttons
is easily readable and navigable by users with visual impairments.
The layout of my website is consistent across all pages, which helps users with cognitive impairments by providing a straightfoward browsing 
experience.
The site is optimized for users who rely on mouse navigation. All interactive elements such as buttons and forms can be accessed and operated 
using a mouse alone.

Usability:
I designed the nav bar to be straightforward and always available for the user so that it helps users find the information they need quickly and 
easily.
I specifically designed my site layout to take full advantage of the larger screen available to desktop devices. Optimizing for desktop users on 
larger screen can fully appreciate the design details and content.
I implemented a modern popup design on my site that includes features like a "Buy Now" button. The popup is designed to provide important 
information without disrupting the user experience. By using a clean and visually appealing design.

Learning:
I have learned how to design and implement popups that are user-friendly and visually appealimg. I achieved this by watching multiple youtube 
tutorials that helped me understand how to implement it.
I have learned how to create event in javascript that helped me improve the website visually such as the "Left" and "Right" buttons so users 
can click it to scroll either left or right.
I have learned how to use create a modern and polished design on CSS. I achieved this by watching multiple youtube tutorials.

Evaluation I:
The "Work" section of my portfolio was particularly successful due to its clean, wel-organized layout that effectively showcasses my projects.
I was able to present each projects with enough space, ensuring that images, titles and descriptions are easy to view and understand. My work 
section was successful because the layout makes it easy for users to navigate through my projects, offering a clear and visually appealing 
way to explore my work

Evaluation II:
Looking back, the "Shop" section of my portfolio is one area I wish I had more time to polish. It felt a bit rushed and if I could do it over,
I would spend more time brainstorming ideas to really make it stand out. Another thing I wish I had more time for is animations. It's a new 
skill for me and I know there's so much more I could do with it. If I had more time, I'd dive deeper into learning CSS.
